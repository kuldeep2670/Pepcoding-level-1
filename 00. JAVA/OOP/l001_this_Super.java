// This and Super

// --->The keyword 'super' is used to represent the current instance of a parent class(var and meth).

// --->The keyword 'this' is used to represent the current instance of a class.
//     This is required when we have a parameter with the same name as instance variable

//--> we can use them both anywhere in a class except static areas.
